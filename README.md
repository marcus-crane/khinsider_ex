# khinsider_ex

A downloader for the KHInsider site, which has a lot of videogame OSTs, in Elixir. It's not usable yet so there's no docs

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `audile` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:audile, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/audile](https://hexdocs.pm/audile).
